#GGA_MSSM_SQCD

Except for diagram 7, to use richardson flag, set it to true and pick order k of the extrapolation then

python3 main.py.

By default, the runs will submit to each order to cluster using sbatch. 

All diagrams are stable below and above quark threshold up to lam=10^-5, where lam is the imaginary shift of quark and squark masses.
