# compliers:
# using cmake for organizing and structured files.
# using clicks for cli interfaces --> no executables creation or bashscript needed. 

# unit testing
# logging systems

# mbrenorm
# renshemes
# integration --> classes --> factory pattern, gg, qg, qq
# inital_sushi <-> real issue --> inheritance from inital class
# sigma --> compsite pattern --> gg, qg, qq subclasses
# checking again with sushi --> possible fix on LO factors (from heavy squark mass limit to full mass dependence)

# integrated gga_mssm_qcd integration part into the code
# create interface
-> using comandlines interface or command pattern desgin ?

# Physics side:
# testing between renormalization --> plot module
# hadronic cross-section, K factors
# deltab and detalt resummation effects.

# all others files are in common directories
# reduce "." in implementation. 
# added alphasqb, alphasqt into csqcd.csv --> today task.
